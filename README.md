# Real-time Object Detection & Translation Web App
Authors: Tiffany Fu, Nicole Lucas, Sherie Lam, Edith Leung

This is a web app that could detect& identify object and provide translation in real-time. 
It is built using Next.js, ONNXRuntime, and YOLOv7 model.

5. 

### Installation as PWA

This app can also be installed on your device (desktop or mobile) as a progressive web app (PWA). Here's how:

1. Visit [the app's URL](https://main.d1oms94am8cez.amplifyapp.com/) in a web browser that supports PWAs (such as Google Chrome or Firefox).
2. Look for the "Install" or "Add to Homescreen" button in the browser's interface. 
3. Click the button and follow the prompts to install the app.
4. The app will now be installed on your device and can be launched from the homescreen like any other app.
